# Deep-Learning-Dog-emotions-classification

- This study investigated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence models in classifying dog emotions using visual cues. We used a dataset of labeled dog images and experimented with various architectures, including the foundational CNN and transfer learning models such as ResNet 50, VGG16, MobileNet V2, and DenseNet 121.
The results showed that DenseNet 121 achieved the best accuracy of 82.63% on the test data. This suggests that DenseNet 121 is a promising model for dog emotion classification.
The findings of this study have implications for the development of pet care and animal-assisted therapies. However, the limited size of the dataset used in this study limits the generalizability of the results. Future research should address this limitation by using larger dataset
